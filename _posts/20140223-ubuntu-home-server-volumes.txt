In my efforts to be a polyglot, both in terms of programming languages and environments, I've decide to move my home server from Windows to Linux.  This will be a challenge, as I've run various home server setups over the years and they've always been Windows (from 2000, to 2003, to 2008R2 and now 2012R2)!
